<p>Lab 4 Below, following the lab handout I wasn't able to make the Geocoder work. I found an online resource
that allowed me to have a functioning Geocoder. Following the lab handout it said that dojo.require() is not a
function and it wouldn't work for me. 
The following links are my attempt at using the lab manual, and then the working Geocoder. 
The first page shows the added feature layers while the second shows the working Geocoder</p>
